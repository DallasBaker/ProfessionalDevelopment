                This is an example of a Technical Docs site for my chapter project on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freeCodeCamp</a> I will be taking some data from the example site provided by the chapter project to fill this out in more detail.

                I will be adding some code examples from the js documentation site freeCodeCamp has provided in this section along with some info.

                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
            </code>
            <p>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            <p>
                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code>while (condition) statement</code>
            <p>
                the following code defines a simple function named square:
            </p>
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <p>
                You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            </p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>

                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                Here is some extra info you should how before reading these a docs with some other information sprinkled in.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
